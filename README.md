Hi there! 

I'm Ashley, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Columbia University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a a research assistant at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory under the supervision of Felix Waldhauser, a software engineer intern with Columbia Build Lab, and a Web Developer at Soltero Media.

I am also developing a social network platform for project-based collaboration alongside Georgina Alcaraz and Bhavya Bellannagari with the support of communities and organizations throughout Boston University, Columbia Univesity, Harvard University, and MIT.

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following developments in math and tech. I also love sailing with Columbia Sailing, playing puzzle games, and making niche playlists on Spotify for my friends.

Let's connect!
