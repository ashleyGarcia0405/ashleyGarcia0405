I'm Ashley, a senior at Columbia University (Engineering). I am studying CS and Applied Mathematics.

I'm primarily interested in backend development and making cool/interactive digital experiences. I currently work as a software engineer intern at Spotify and a research assistant at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory under the supervision of Felix Waldhauser. I am also the lead mentor for Hydra Robotics (2425 FRC + FTC).

Some stuff I'm a part of: Columbia Sailing raceteam, Womenx Innovators, CORE (Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs), Columbia Science Review.

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following developments in art and tech. I also love sailing, playing puzzle games, going to hackathons, and making niche playlists on Spotify for my friends.
