Hi there! 

I'm Ashley, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Columbia University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer intern with Columbia Build Lab and a Web Developer at Soltero Media.

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following developments in physics and tech. I also love sailing with Columbia Sailing, playing puzzle games, and making niche playlists on Spotify for my friends.

Let's connect!
