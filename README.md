Hi there! 

I'm Ashley, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Columbia University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and making cool/interactive digital experiences. I currently work as a software engineer at Soltero Media and a research assistant at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory under the supervision of Felix Waldhauser. I am also the lead mentor for Hydra Robotics (2425 FRC + FTC).

Some stuff I'm a part of: Womenx Innovators, CORE OCL, Columbia Science Review.

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following developments in art and tech. I also love sailing with Columbia Sailing, playing puzzle games, participating in hackathons, and making niche playlists on Spotify for my friends.

Let's connect!
