Hi there! 

I'm Ashley, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Columbia University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and making cool/interactive digital experiences. I'm currently work as a software engineer at Soltero Media and a research assistant at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory under the supervision of Felix Waldhauser. I am also the lead mentor for Hydra Robotics (2425 FRC + FTC).

I am developing a social network platform for project-based collaboration alongside Georgina Alcaraz and Bhavya Bellannagari with the support of communities and organizations throughout Boston University, Columbia, Harvard, and MIT.

Outside of work and school, I'm interested in following developments in art and tech. I also love sailing with Columbia Sailing, playing puzzle games, participating in hackathons, and making niche playlists on Spotify for my friends.

Let's connect!
